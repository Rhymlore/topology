Description: This project studies the implementation of a public policy that restricts gender-based pricing in the Chilean private health insurance system. For that matter, I will estimate how enrollees choose plans and how sensitive they are to prices in this market using a discrete choice demand model. With these estimates in hand, I will simulate how people choose plans once prices are restricted to be the same between men and women, and how the structure of the market, in terms of costs, changes after the implementation of the policy.
