Description: The Beryllium Electron capture in Superconducting Tunnel
  junctions Experiment (BEeST) employs the decayâ€“momentum reconstruction
  technique to precisely measure the 7Be 7Li recoil energy spectrum in
  superconducting tunnel junctions (STJs). This approach is a powerful,
  model-independent method in the search for beyond SM scenarios since
  it relies only on the existence of a heavy neutrino admixture to the
  active neutrinos.
