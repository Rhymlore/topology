Description: The ultimate goal is to train machine-learning-type models
  (e.g. GANs or CNNs) on DNA and RNA reads in order to classify both kinds
  of data into a common set of clusters. The application of this research
  is to improve our understanding of cancer development and progression by
  integrating single-cell genomic and transcriptomic data from the same
  patient. We plan on training these models on publicly available datasets
  that include both transcriptomic and genomic short reads, after first
  reducing those datasets to per-gene read counts.
