Description: "The goal of this project is to test and validate the Sherpa\nand Blackhat\
  \ software for particle physics phenomenology at the\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC),\
  \ and to perform studies which are directly\napplicable to physics analyses in the\
  \ LHC experiments ATLAS and CMS.\n\nSherpa is a complete Monte-Carlo event generation\
  \ framework\nfor collider experiments. Hard scattering events are simulated\nusing\
  \ perturbative QCD at the leading or the next-to-leading\norder with the help of\
  \ BlackHat. QCD Resummation is implemented\nby an in-house parton shower model based\
  \ on the dipole factorization\napproach. Hadronization is performed in a cluster\
  \ model and\na complete hadron decay simulation is included in the program.\n\n\
  BlackHat is a program library to compute virtual corrections\nin perturbative QCD\
  \ based on generalized unitarity methods.\nIt is used to produce particle-level\
  \ cross sections for\nphenomenologically relevant signal and background reactions\n\
  of high particle multiplicity at the Large Hadron Collider.\n\nRecent progress achieved\
  \ with the combination of BlackHat and\nSherpa is described at \n  https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Management/Nov2012Newsletter#Precision_Event_Simulation_for_t"
