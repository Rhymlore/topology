Description: >
  The Platform for Single-Cell Science is a tool for improving both the reproducibility and accessibility of analytical 
  pipelines developed for single-cell multiomics. Researchers will be able to upload their data, create an analysis pipeline
  using our javascript designer, and link their results to a publication. The raw data, analysis, and results will be made 
  available for interactive exploration or download when users are ready to publish. We are hoping to understand if there 
  is a way we can use OSG by sending jobs that are prepared on our website hosted on AWS to the OSG for execution.
