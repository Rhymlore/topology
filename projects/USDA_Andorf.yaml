Description: >
  The research is part of the Maize Genetics and Genomics Database (MaizeGD) to utilize protein structure models to improve maize functional genomics.
  The project will generate new protein structure models to improve functional classification, canonical isoform detection, 
  gene structure annotation, and assigning confidence scores to point mutations based on the likelihood to change function.
