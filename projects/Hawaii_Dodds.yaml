Description: We experimentally develop efficient means of distribution to
  federated national cyberinfrastructure (CI) platforms of Hawaii astronomy 
  big data sets. We will demonstrate use of these data sets with OSG and other
  CI platforms using SOTA AI/ML research methods applied to astronomy and
  astrophysics research questions. We hope to publish a collection of
  canonical ML models that work efficiently with these astronomy big data
  sets utilizing national, regional and campus CI resources.
