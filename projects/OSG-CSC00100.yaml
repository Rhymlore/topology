Description: Develop a metric that measures the real similarities and differences
  between machine learning algorithms (in this case classifiers) based on output behavior.  Previous
  study included 17 representative algorithms and used 30 datasets from the UCI Machine
  Learning Repository.  The main goal of the current effort is to extend the metric
  using semi-supervised learning techniques. I would also like, if possible, to experiment
  with more recent datasets beyond what is traditional from the UCI Repository; and
  to add more algorithms to the study.
