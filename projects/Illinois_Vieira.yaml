Description: The Observational Cosmology Laboratory (ObsCos) work explores the early universe through the echos of the big bang, known as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The ObsCos lab is developing cryogenic optics for next-generation CMB experiments. This R&D exposes students to clean-room tasks, software simulation, electronics, data acquisition and involvement in a large scale scientific research project.
