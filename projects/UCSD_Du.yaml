Description: Our research group focuses on developing quantum sensing and imaging
  techniques to study various properties (spin, charge, and heat, etc) of quantum
  materials in the nanometer scale. In addition, we design and engineer hybrid quantum
  devices to achieve efficient qubit control for quantum information applications.
  Our research tools are versatile, including optical measurement based on nitrogen
  vacancy center in diamond, transport and microwave spectroscopy as well as scanning
  probe magnetometry.
