Description: "In this collaborative project between bioinformatics and physics we\
  \ use molecular evolution simulations to evolve a population of proteins. We look\
  \ for the emergence of mutational robustness of proteins in the population. This\
  \ quantity measures how resistant they are to the deleterious effects of mutations.\
  \ Previous results from Dr. Massey's group suggest that mutational robustness increases\
  \ and eventually converges over time. This appears to be an emergent property of\
  \ proteins. It has profound evolutionary implications. \n\nThe protein structures\
  \ are obtained from the Protein Data Bank. Non-robust sequences are threaded onto\
  \ the structure and are subjected to random mutations. The resulting sequences are\
  \ selected for their free energy of folding. Once the sequences are generated the\
  \ mutational robustness is calculated in parallel (through Condor)."
