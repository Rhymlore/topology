Description: 'Earthquake Engineering is moving towards performance based

  engineering. Performance based engineering will potentially

  require and exponentially increase the amount of computation

  required of engineers as engineers move to incorporate risk and

  uncertainty associated with hazard, modeling, cost, material,

  etc. into the simulations. Currently those in research mostly are

  using the OpenSees (http://opensees.berkeley.edu) application to

  perform these calculations. This project aims at providing these

  researchers with access to current versions of OpenSees by

  utilizing resources to build the application on OSG resources.'
