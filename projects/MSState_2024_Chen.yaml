Description: >
    This project is dedicated to creating a comprehensive multimodal platform, specifically designed to enhance graph dynamics analytics in professional settings.Our goal is to encompass the complete life cycle of graph dynamics with particular emphasis on spatial trajectory mining, including location prediction, optimal routing inference, and identity recognition.
    Central to this initiative is utilization the capabilities of large transformer models (e.g., Large Language Models, Vision Transformers, or Graph Transformers). These will be tailored to effectively capture the complexities inherent in trajectory over spatial graphs. By leveraging natural language, we can unlock the potential of advanced graph analytics to those without programming expertise, and enable seamless collaboration between experts across domains by speaking the universal language.
