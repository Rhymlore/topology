Description: >
  Bootstrap hypothesis testing methods for time series - 
  we are trying to compute the rejection probabilities of our hypothesis 
  testing method as a measure of their efficacy. This requires generating 
  several samples of time series for a given sample size and hyperparameter 
  specification and running our test repeatedly to compute the empirical 
  rejection probability. This is done over several sample sizes and hyperparameter specs.
