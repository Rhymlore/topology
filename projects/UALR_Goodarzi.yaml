Description: >
  focus on drug discovery for infection and cancer, leveraging computational methods. 
  Specifically, I utilize computation for analyzing protein-protein interactions, protein-ligand interactions, and multivariate analysis.
  This approach aids in identifying potential drug targets and understanding molecular mechanisms. 
  Overall, my work integrates computational tools to advance drug discovery efforts against infection and cancer.
