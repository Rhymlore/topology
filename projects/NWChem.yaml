Description: The goal of this work is to provide a federated heterogeneous infrastructure
  that can be federated on demand for scientists and scientific applications.  The
  goal of this work is to integrate OSG as a part of the federated infrastructure
  cloud. The federation leverages the CometCloud software, currently being developed
  at Rutgers University. NWChem is the initial application to be used on OSG resources.
  A parallel in time algorithm will run multiple NWChem instances on the OSG resources,
  where each instance has different input parameters. The collective output of all
  instances is then gathered and analyzed.
