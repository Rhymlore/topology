Description: "There is now a large body of experimental evidence that the ability\
  \ of many proteins to reach full functionality in a cell depends strongly on the\
  \ rate at which individual codons are translated by the ribosome during protein\
  \ synthesis. This project aims to demonstrate that, counter to conventional wisdom,\
  \ fast-translating codons can help coordinate co-translational protein folding by\
  \ minimizing misfolding [O\u2019Brien, Nature Comm. 2014]. To do this we will use\
  \ a two-step approach: First (Aim 1), we will utilize coarse-grained molecular dynamics\
  \ simulations in combination with a genetic algorithm to find the optimal codon\
  \ translation rate profile that maximizes the co-translational folding of a protein.\
  \ And then (Aim 2) mutate, in silico, fast-translating codon positions to slower\
  \ rates to test, if as predicted, we observe a concomitant decrease in the amount\
  \ of co-translational folding. The results of this study will provide a new computational\
  \ tool for the rational design of mRNA sequences to control nascent proten behavior."
