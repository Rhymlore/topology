Description: >
  The Strother Lab focuses on questions at the interface between physiology and physics. 
  Our lab is especially interested in understanding processes at multiple levels of organization, 
  from the properties of individual cells up to the responses of the whole animal. 
  Current projects in the lab examine a range of topics, including the effects of stress on animal behavior,
  nervous control of the cardiovascular system, and sensory physiology. See also www.strotherlab.org.
