Description: NOAA Fisheries uses stock assessments to monitor the
  condition of nearly 500 fish stocks and stock complexes (groups of
  similar stocks managed together). Stock assessments are scientific
  efforts that involve data collection, data processing, and mathematical
  modeling that estimate the health and size of a fish stock, measure
  how fishing affects the stock, and project harvest levels that achieve
  the largest sustainable long-term yield. Stock assessments are the
  backbone of sustainable fisheries management. These assessments allow
  us to evaluate and report the status of managed fisheries, marine
  mammals, and endangered/threatened species under the authorities of
  the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the
  Marine Mammal Protection Act, and the Endangered Species Act. The
  outcome of this project will be to develop and document a workflow
  for running existing stock assessment platforms (e.g. StockSynthesis,
  Multifan-CL, Beaufort Assessment Model, etc.) on a distributed computing
  system in order to facilitate the script based, ‘simultaneous’
  exploration of multiple alternative model configurations. This workflow
  can be used to develop a stock assessment in either the single best
  base case or ensemble model framework. This project will support
  hypothesis exploration, model ensembling, and improved automation of
  stock assessments.
