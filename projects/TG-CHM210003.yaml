Description: This will allow for the determination of relative solubility
  of polymeric materials in alcohol solvents, similar to the shampoo and
  shaving cream materials. An understanding of the free energy of solvation
  and surface activity of polyethers and polysilicones will allow for the
  optimization of alcohol content in such mixtures to get the best bang
  for the buck in solubilizing and surface tension optimized alcohol-water
  mixtures with these polymers present.
