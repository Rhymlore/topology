Description: Our group studies how to improve science by automating
  and optimizing the tools used by domain scientists. We do this
  primarily by making input specific parameter value choices which
  help to reduce false information introduced by using less than
  ideal (or default) parameter choice. The focus of the work
  performed here will be on data acquisition for the machine
  learning processes needed to further develop these methods used
  for making such choices for multiple sequence alignment
  applications. https://deblasiolab.org/
