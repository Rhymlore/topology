Description: "Predicting Long-Term T Cell Responses to SARS-CoV-2 via Molecular Modeling and Machine Learning
https://covid19-hpc-consortium.org/projects/5ebf07523e6ec40081202fac

The dynamics of COVID-19 infection remain poorly understood, and it is unknown
 whether patients acquire prolonged immunity to the virus following initial
 infection. Most current vaccine efforts mainly promote B cell production of
 neutralizing antibodies. While often critical for virus neutralization and
 disease control, research from the 2002-2003 SARS-CoV epidemic suggests that
 B cells and serum antibodies involved in the initial immune response are
 likely to be short-lived. However, many patients with undetectable antibody
 levels retained immune protection by virtue of long-lived T cells, and
 correlation of T cell recovery with convalescence in COVID-19 strongly
 suggests that T cells are critical for virus control. By computationally
 simulating hundreds of thousands of interactions between T cells and
 COVID-19-infected cells, we aim to characterize the biochemical features of
 T cells responsible for long-term COVID-19 immunity and identify a small
 number of viral molecules that have the highest likelihood of
 inducing long-term immunity when delivered through vaccines."
